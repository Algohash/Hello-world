Install the cx_Oracle package
pip install cx_Oracle

If there is an error
    cx_Oracle.c:10:10: fatal error: 'oci.h' file not found
    #include <oci.h>
             ^
    1 error generated.
    error: command 'clang' failed with exit status 1

You might have to download Instant Client SDK package from Oracle (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html) and copy the sdk directory into $ORACLE_HOME

Also make sure
export ORACLE_HOME = /oracle/directory
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = $ORACLE_HOME
EXPORT LYLD_LIBRARY_PATH = $ORACLE_HOME/lib

Once this is done, you can make the connection and query the DB.
import cx_Oracle as ora
oConn = ora.connect('uid/pwd@server:port/db')

cur=oConn.cursor()
sql="select * from table"
cur.execute(sql)
cur.fetchall()

If you want to have it read as a data frame
data_df = pd.read_sql(sql, oConn)
